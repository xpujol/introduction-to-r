# Introduction to R scripts

# To run a command in RStudio, go to a specific line and press [CMD]+[ENTER] (or [CTRL]+[ENTER] on Windows)

#
# 1. TO GET STARTED
#

# Basic math operations
4 + 3 # you'll see a [1] appearing at the left of the result. This is a reference (we'll take a look at it later)
4 * 3
cos(0)

# Variables and assignments
x # doesn't exist yet
x <- 4
x
x + 3

y <- sqrt(x)
y
x + y

# Vectors: ordered lists
x <- c(2,3) # create a vector concatenating the values 2 and 3
x

x <- seq(0, 10, 1) # sequence from 0 to 9, with step 1
x

y <- seq(0, 10, 0.1) # sequence from 0 to 9, with step 0.1
y # take a look at the reference numbers [1], ...
# Now make the console window smaller and run the previous command again. You'll see the reference numbers changing

y <- x^2 # operations are automatically applied element-wise (like a javascript map() method)
y

# Let's draw!
plot(x, y)
plot(y, x)

# Try It Yourself!
# Obtain a vector z which is the result of multiplying by 3 each number of the vector x
z <- ...
# Easy, right? :)

# Matrices
A <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 5, ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)
A

B <- matrix(data = x, nrow = 5, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
B

B[3, 2] # access an element
B[5, 2] <- 0 # assign a new value to an element
B

# Help! I need somebody!
# Type "? + function_name" to get help
?plot
?c


#
# 2. READING AND ANALYZING REAL DATA
#

# Now we'll use some real data.
# There's plenty of open data websites out there, we'll use OpenDataBarcelona as an example http://opendata.bcn.cat/opendata/

# Load data using a URL or a local relative path
# In this case, population of Barcelona by gender, age and household occupation per district
D <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpujol/introduction-to-r/master/datasets/barcelona_age_gender_occupation.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

# Take a look at the variable D. It's a type of variable called "data frame". We'll talk again about data frames later
D

# Use the "$" operator to access a certain column
D$AGE_AVG
# That's equivalent if you know the column number (columns are numbered starting from 1)
D[,3]

# Analysis of 1 variable
plot(D$AGE_AVG, xlab="Barcelona neighborhoods", ylab="Average age")
plot(D$PERC_FEMALE, xlab="Barcelona neighborhoods", ylab="Percentage of female population")
plot(D$HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, xlab="Barcelona neighborhoods", ylab="Household size")
# We don't see much here, we can just guess whether or not the neighborhoods are homogeneous in terms of age, female population, etc

# Let's group de data per district:
boxplot(D$AGE_AVG ~ D$DISTRICT, xlab="Barcelona districts", ylab="Average age")
# In what district have all the neighbourhoods a low average age?

# Now draw the boxplots for Female population and Household size per district
boxplot(..., xlab="Barcelona neighborhoods", ylab="Percentage of female population")
boxplot(..., xlab="Barcelona neighborhoods", ylab="Household size")

# Let's draw all the variables together
# With pch you can change the icon used to draw the plot
pairs(~AGE_AVG+PERC_FEMALE+HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, data=D, pch=24)

# What variables do you think are corelated?
# Try replacing the values of VARIABLE1 and VARIABLE2 to see the linear regression of two correlated variables
plot(D$VARIABLE1, D$VARIABLE2, col = "red", xlab = "Description of VARIABLE1", ylab = "Description of VARIABLE2")
model <- lm(D$VARIABLE2 ~ D$VARIABLE1)
abline(model, col = "blue", lty = 2)
legend("bottomright", inset = .05, c("observations", "adjustment"), col = c("red","blue"), pch = c(1,NA), lty = c(NA,2))


#
# 3. THE IRIS DATA FRAME
#

# iris ??s un data.frame ja existent a R
iris_df <- iris
class(iris)
# Imagineu un data.frame com una especie de matriu on puc barrejar columnes de diferents tipus, per exemple en aquest cas 4 num??riques i una categ??rica.
# S'utilitza tipicament per a representar datasets, on tenim columnes (amb nom) per a les features i una per a les classes
names(iris)
# Puc escollir les columnes pel seu nom i hi puc afegir condicions
iris$Sepal.Length
iris[iris$Sepal.Length > 5, c("Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length")]
iris[iris$Sepal.Length > 5, c(2, 3)]
# Podem veure estad??stiques b??siques del dataset
summary(iris)
# ??dhuc estratificat per classe!
by(iris_df, iris_df$Species, summary)
# Podem fer plot per parelles i que cada row tingui un color diferent segons la classe
pairs(iris_df[1:4], pch = 24, bg = c("red", "green3", "blue")[unclass(iris$Species)])

# executeu "sudo R CMD javareconf" al vostre terminal

train <- sample(1:150, 120)
z <- lda(Species ~ Sepal.Length , iris_df, prior = c(1,1,1)/3, subset = train)
sum((predict(z, iris_df[-train, ])$class == iris_df$Species[-train]))/30

# 4. SHINY: A WEB APPLICATION FRAMEWORK FOR R
#

# Install the "shiny" package (a package is a library offering extra functionality to the base R components)
install.packages("shiny")

# Load the package
library(shiny)

# We'll run a shiny app located in the folder "my-shiny-app" of this repo. Take a look at the files inside that folder.
# Shiny apps have two components:
#  1. a user-interface script (ui.R), which controls the layout and appearance of your app
#  2. a server script (script.R), which contains the instructions that your computer or server needs to build your app

# Run our shiny app
# (change the path to the right one. It must be relative to your working directory)
getwd() # get your working directory
runApp("uz/r/introduction-to-r/my-shiny-app") # write the path relative to your working directory
